# API Demo: How to Pull Data From Other Websites #

Here is a one-page demo of accessing an API and displaying its contents on a page. This all happens on one single page, and is pretty easy to understand.

## Getting Started ##

There are no dependencies for this project, just two HTML files. Paste the contents of **index.html** into your favorite text/code editor, and follow along at (*video URL will be available soon*). 


## Deployment / Viewing The Demo ##

You'll end up with something that looks like completed.html, which you can run in your browser from Localhost or upload to your webhosting account to see.

**You will not be able to run this from the file protocol** So these paths will not work:
````
c:/documents/completed.html
/home/user/completed.html
````
But you can run it from a path like:
````
http://localhost/completed.html 
http://your-website-name.com/completed.html
````
